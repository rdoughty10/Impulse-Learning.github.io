These are the backend files for our planned summer camp.


## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
